        "answer": "Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library to run web applications outside the client's browser. It is used to create server-side web applications. Node.js is perfect for data-intensive applications as it uses an asynchronous, event-driven model."

You may export a module with the module and export the function, which lets it be imported into another file with a needed keyword."

        "answer": "Asynchronous literally means not synchronous. We are making HTTP requests which are asynchronous, means we are not waiting for the server response. We  continue with other block and respond to the server response when we received.The term Non-Blocking is widely used with IO. For example non-blocking read/write calls return with whatever they can do and expect caller to execute the call again. Read will wait until it has some data and put calling thread to sleep."

        "answer": "setImmediate() and setTimeout() are similar, but behave in different ways depending on when they are called. setImmediate() is designed to execute a script once the current poll (event loop) phase completes. setTimeout() schedules a script to be run after a minimum threshold in ms has elapsed."

Instead, the nextTickQueue will be processed after the current operation completes, regardless of the current phase of the event loop. Thus, any time you call process.nextTick() in a given phase, all callbacks passed to process.nextTick() will be resolved before the event loop continues."

When the node.js project began in 2009 as a JavaScript environment decoupled from the browser, it is using Google's V8 and Marc Lehmann's libev, node.js combined a model of I/O - evented - with a language that was well suited to the style of programming; due to the way it had been shaped by browsers. As node.js grew in popularity, it was important to make it work on Windows, but libev ran only on Unix. libuv was an abstraction around libev or IOCP depending on the platform, providing users an API based on libev. In the node-v0.9.0 version of libuv libev was removed."

        "answer": "DOCTYPE is an abbreviation for Document Type. defines how documents of a certain type should be structured (i.e. a button can contain a span but not a div), whereas a DOCTYPE declares what DTD a document supposedly respects (i.e. this document respects the HTML DTD).For webpages, the DOCTYPE declaration is required. It is used to tell user agents what version of the HTML specifications your document respects. Once a user agent has recognized a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the no-quirks mode matching this DOCTYPE for reading the document. If a user agent doesn't recognize a correct DOCTYPE, it will trigger the quirks mode.The DOCTYPE declaration for the HTML5 standards is <!DOCTYPE html>."

        "answer": "When an HTTP request is made to a server, the requesting user agent usually sends information about language preferences, such as in the Accept-Language header. The server can then use this information to return a version of the document in the appropriate language if such an alternative is available. The returned HTML document should also declare the lang attribute in the <html> tag, such as <html lang={en}> </html>."

Text in raster-based images(png, gif,jpg, etc) is not a scalable approach. Restrictive words/sentence length, some content can be longer when written in other languages. Be mindful of how colors are perceived across languages and cultures. Don't concatenate translated strings, it can break in other languages. Instead use temperate literals.

        "answer": "CSS <link>s are placed in the top for optimization to get data to the user faster. <script> tags block HTML parsing while they are being downloaded and executed which can slow down your page. Placing the scripts at the bottom will allow the HTML to be parsed and displayed to the user first. An exception for positioning of <script>s at the bottom is when your script contains document.write(), but these days it's not a good practice to use document.write()."

        "answer": " All JavaScript objects have a ‘proto’ property (with the exception of objects created with __Object.create(null)__) , that is a reference to another object, which is called the object's 'prototype'. When a property is accessed on an object and if the property is not found on that object, the JavaScript engine looks at the object's __proto__, and the __proto__'s __proto__ and so on, until it finds the property defined on one of the __proto__s or until it reaches the end of the prototype chain."

CommonJS is synchronous while AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) is obviously asynchronous. CommonJS is designed with server-side development in mind while AMD, with its support for asynchronous loading of modules, is more intended for browsers."

        "answer": "IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expressions. The JavaScript parser reads function foo(){ }(); as function foo(){ } and ();, where the former is a function declaration and the latter (a pair of parentheses) is an attempt at calling a function but there is no name specified, hence it throws Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ). It can be fixed by adding more parentheses: (function foo(){ })() and (function foo(){ }()). Statements that begin with function are considered to be function declarations; by wrapping this function within (), it becomes a function expression which can then be executed with the subsequent (). These functions are no longer exposed in the global scope."

        "answer": "Undeclared variables are created when you assign a value to an identifier that is not previously created using var, let or const. To check for them, wrap its usage in a try/catch block. A variable that is undefined is a variable that has been declared, but not assigned a value. To check for it, compare using the strict equality (===) operator or typeof which will give the 'undefined' string. A variable that is null will have been explicitly assigned to the null value. It represents no value and is different from undefined in the sense that it has been explicitly assigned. To check for null, simply compare using the strict equality operator."

        "answer": "A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time. Among other things, closures are commonly used to give objects data privacy."

A map iterates through the elements in an array and 'maps' each element to a new element by calling the function on each element, creating a new array as a result . The main difference between .forEach and .map() is that .map() returns a new array. If you need the result, but do not wish to mutate the original array, .map() is the clear choice.
